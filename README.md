Problem Statement

Design and implement a Student Record Management System using Java
that allows for the management of student records (add, update, delete, search,
and view) with persistent storage. The application must support exception
handling, file handling (to store and retrieve data), multithreading (to
simulate loading), and must leverage the Java Collections Framework. The
system should allow sorting of students by marks, provide the option to search and
delete student records, and display the sorted list of students. Additionally, the
system should use OOP concepts like inheritance, abstraction, and interfaces to
ensure modular and reusable code.

Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this assignment, the students will be able to:

1. Design and implement an object-oriented system using classes, inheritance,
   and interfaces.

3. Use exception handling to ensure safe program execution and validation.
 
4. Implement file I/O for persistent data storage using Java's
   
5. BufferedReader and BufferedWriter.

6. Use Java Collections (List, Map, Set) to manage and manipulate student
   records.
   
7. Sort student records using Comparator and display records via Iterator.
 
8. Implement and understand multithreading for responsive user
    interaction.

9. Apply custom exceptions and perform input validation.
    
10. Understand modular programming with packages for better code
   organization and reusability.
